First, the necessary libraries for building and training the model are imported. TensorFlow and Keras are deep learning frameworks used to build neural networks. Numpy is a library for numerical operations and manipulation of arrays. Matplotlib is a library for visualization. Dropout is a regularization technique that helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training.                     
Second, the MNIST dataset is loaded, which consists of images of handwritten digits and their corresponding labels. The dataset is split into a training set and a test set.
Third, the pixel values of the images are normalized to be between 0 and 1. This helps the model to converge faster during training by reducing the range of values the model needs to learn to deal with.
Fourth, a neural network model is built using the Sequential API. The first layer flattens the input image to a 1D array. The subsequent layers are fully connected (Dense) layers with different numbers of neurons and activation functions. Dropout layers are added after each fully connected layer to prevent overfitting. The final layer has 10 neurons and uses the softmax activation function to output a probability distribution over the 10 classes.
Fifth, the model is compiled, specifying the optimizer ('rmsprop'), the loss function ('sparse_categorical_crossentropy'), and the metrics to track during training (accuracy).
Sixth, the model is trained using the fit method. The number of epochs to train for is specified (50), along with the validation split to use (0.1: the training data will be used for validation), and an early stopping callback to stop training if the validation loss does not improve for 3 consecutive epochs.
Finally, the trained model is evaluated on the test data and the test accuracy is printed, which provides an estimate of how well the model will generalize to new data.
